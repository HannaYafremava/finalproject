            <img src="img/me.JPG" height="220" width="180" align="right"/> Hello, my name is Hanna. I am 25 years old. I have been living in America for over 6 years.
            Currently, I am a junior student at New Jersey Institute of Technology and will graduate in 2020.
            My major is Business and Information Systems. I am taking a lot of classes in business, finance, information systems, programming, web development, and many others.
            My degree provides a good source of knowledge and skills which will advance my career
            and will help me to design, analyze, implement, deploy and evaluate the computing systems that drive modern enterprise.
            I like to work with the program development and information systems, and I develop my skills and knowledge every day.
            In near future, I am looking to get internship in companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Bloomberg, or JPMorgan Chase & Co.
